NOT APPROVED BY THE CAATS PARLEMENT




<p><b>SECTION I
No destruction of property of others</b></p>


<p>You are under no circumstances to purposely destroy anyone's cubes, stack mats, and property of others.
This has NO exceptions and will NOT be tolerated.
Failure to follow this rule could result in a  TEMPBAN from the club.</p>


<p><b>SECTION II
Be respectful of others</b></p>

<p>Be respectful and kind at all times while in competitions and DON'T trash-talk, swear, curse, talk about NSFW, or any inappropriate content.
Competitions are ONLY for fun and getting upset, being a sore loser is NOT ALLOWED. Always talk in a good sports manner. 
Failure to comply with this rule will result in a BAN from competitions.</p>


<p><b>SECTION III
Fair competitions</b></p>


<p>All of our competitions are FAIR and Free. You are NOT allowed to use blacklisted mods. The competition rules are below.</p>

<p><b>End of TOS</b></p>



<p><b>RULES</b></p>


<p>These competitions rules will be in effect during competitions: </p>

<p>+2s and DNFs</p>

<p>No penalty: the cube is solved and the misalignments of all layers compared with their adjacent layers are below 45°. </p>

<p>+2: the cube is solved, but the misaligned layer exceeds 45°, which means the cube is one move away from being solved. Please note that the WCA Regulations consider all states of the puzzle to be one move away from the solved state if you have to turn only one side of the puzzle to reach the solved state – even if it’s a double turn. <p>

<p>Ask the Delegate: If it’s not clear whether a +2 penalty should be applied or not, don’t touch the puzzle and call a Delegate to the station. </p>


<p>If the cube is dropped and did not impact the mat, then it is a +2. If the timer is started using the palms, while touching the cube, or it is stopped while still touching the cube, then it is considered a +2.</p>


<p>DNF: When more than one move is required to solve the puzzle, the result of the attempt is DNF.</p>
